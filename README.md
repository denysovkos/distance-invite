# distance-invite

## Challenge

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending). We recommend you use whatever language you feel strongest in. It doesn't have to be one we use!

## Solution

A CLI written using Nodejs (14.15.0).

### Getting started

- Nodejs version 12 or higher

- Run `npm install` 

- Run `npm run start` to see the magic
  
- The test suite, run `npm run test` to run all test cases.
